# NewsCake

It is a news website.
It was made by using the ReactJS framework and React Routers.
Its main page looks like this:

It has some interesting features too.
Here, We are providing 7 different categories of news including :

Here, you can click the buttons shown in Navbar and filter news per your topics.

It has Infinite sliding technology for non-stop scrolling.
It also has a loading graphic component as GIF and a Top loading bar for a good user experience.

Here, as shown in the picture after we click on the Science button to filter news on the main page:

At every news card, there is a button for “Read More”, this button opens a main source page from where the news came from in a new tab automatically.

Enjoy my project.
